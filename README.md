# Server-Side API Requests with Axios
This repository contains the code and materials for the lesson on making server-side API requests using the Axios library, as part of the Angela Web Development course on Udemy.

## Overview
In this lesson, we'll explore how to use the Axios library to make HTTP requests to a server-side API. Axios is a popular JavaScript library that provides a simple and elegant interface for making XMLHttpRequests from the browser and performing CRUD operations on REST endpoints.

- Introducing Axios and its features
- Making GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests with Axios
- Handling response data and error handling
- Sending headers and query parameters with Axios
- Implementing simple API requests in a web application

The code examples and exercises in this repository will help you practice and solidify your understanding of using Axios for server-side API communication.
